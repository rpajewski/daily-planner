# Work Day Daily Planner

## Description:
This application is a daily planner that uses light HTML, CSS and Javascript to allow the user to save tasks and have a visual hourly indicator (gray, green or red textarea boxes) of the current time of day.

The application will load any data storaged in the local storage using javascript. It will then run a local time function using Moment.js and display it at the top of the page. After that the application will set classes for each time block based on the time of day it is. The time blocks will appear gray if they are old, red if its the current hour and green for future tasks.
